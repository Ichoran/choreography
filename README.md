# Choreography

Choreography is analysis software for post-capture analysis of _C. elegans_ behavior.

When a new version is ready, it will appear here.  Before it is ready, parts of it will appear here and be in flux.

### To build

Use SBT (Scala Build Tool).

Yes, it's a Java project, but I don't really like Maven or Ant, and makefiles are so 80s.
